This project delves into the application and development of NLP models to accurately identify sarcastic intent within textual data. We explore the efficacy of deep learning models, including an SVM, a Random Forest model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and a custom-designed model which integrates the complementary capabilities of CNN and LSTM, structured sequentially to process the BERT-preprocessed input data, in identifying sarcasm within textual data and compare the results using the evaluation metrics.
